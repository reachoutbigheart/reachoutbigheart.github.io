About 2 in every 100 people will at some stage in their life acquire it, so there are approximately 90,000 people with epilepsy in Queensland. There are two peaks for epilepsy onset: childhood/ adolescence and in people over 60 years old. People with any form of structural brain abnormalities including cerebral palsy, brain injury, autism or intellectual disability have a much higher rate of epilepsy."
