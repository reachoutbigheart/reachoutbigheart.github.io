Some causes include: \n- acquired brain injury\u2028- loss of oxygen (hypoxia)\n- infections such as encephalitis\n- strokes, tumours or cysts \n- cerebrovascular degeneration in the elderly \n- genetic causes. These may be inherited in the family or they may be caused by a new genetic abnormality that occurs during the earliest stage of foetal development."
